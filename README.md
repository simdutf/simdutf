simdutf: insanely fast Unicode validation and transcoding
===============================================

Most modern software relies on the [Unicode standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). In memory, Unicode strings are represented using either
UTF-8 or UTF-16. The UTF-8 format is the de facto standard on the web (JSON, HTML, etc.) and it has been adopted as the default in many popular
programming languages (Go, Rust, Swift, etc.). The UTF-16 format is standard in Java, C# and in many Windows technologies.

Not all sequences of bytes are valid Unicode strings. It is unsafe to use Unicode strings in UTF-8 and UTF-16 without first validating them. Furthermore, we often need to convert strings from one encoding to another, by a process called [transcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding). For security purposes, such transcoding should be validating: it should refuse to transcode incorrect strings.

This library provide fast Unicode functions such as

- UTF-8 and UTF-16 validation,
- UTF-8 to UTF-16 transcoding, with or without validation,
- UTF-16 to UTF-8 transcoding, with or without validation,
- UTF-8 and UTF-16 character counting.

The functions are accelerated using SIMD instructions (e.g., ARM NEON, SSE, AVX, etc.). When your strings contain hundreds of characters, we can often transcode them at speeds exceeding a billion caracters per second. You should expect high speeds not only with English strings (ASCII) but also Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and so forth. We handle the full character range (including, for example, emojis).

The library compiles down to tens of kilobytes. Our functions are exception-free and non allocating. We have extensive tests.

How fast is it?
-----------------

System: AMD Rome (Zen2), ICU version 67.1, GNU GCC 10. [Lipsum data files](https://github.com/lemire/unicode_lipsum).

UTF-16 to UTF-8 transcoding (with validation):

|    |ICU |Â  simdutf | ratio|
----|-----|----------|------
|Arabic | 0.42 | 4.2 | 10x |
|Chinese | 0.39 | 3.0 | 8x |
|Emoji | 0.23 | 0.32 | 1.4x |
|Hebrew | 0.59 | 4.2 | 7x |
|Hindi | 0.24 | 2.9 | 12x |
|Japanese | 0.30 | 2.8 | 9x |
|Korean | 0.39 | 2.8 | 7x |
|Latin | 0.93 | 18. | 19x |
|Russian | 0.27 | 4.2 | 15x |

UTF-8 to UTF-16 transcoding (with validation):

|  | ICU | simdutf | ratio|
----|-----|----------|------
|Arabic | 0.29 | 1.4 | 5x |
|Chinese | 0.39 | 1.3 | 3x |
|Emoji | 0.15 | 0.47 | 3x |

Requirements
-------

- C++11 compatible compiler. We support LLVM clang, GCC, Visual Studio. (Our optional benchmark tool requires C++17.)
- Recent CMake (at least 3.15)

Usage
-------

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
cd build
ctest .
```

To run benchmarks, execute the `benchmark` command. You can get help on its
usage by first building it and then calling it with the `--help` flag.
E.g., under Linux you may do the following:

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/benchmarks/benchmark --help
```

Single-header version
----------------------

You can create a single-header version of the library where
all of the code is put into two files (`simdutf.h` and `simdutf.cpp`).

```
python3 ./singleheader/amalgamate.py
```

Under Linux and macOS, you may test it as follows:

```
cd singleheader
c++ -o amalgamation_demo amalgamation_demo.cpp -std=c++17
./amalgamation_demo
```

Example
---------

Using the single-header version, you could compile the following program.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include "simdutf.h"
#include "simdutf.cpp"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   const char * ascii = "1234";
   bool validutf8 = simdutf::validate_utf8(ascii, 4);
   if(validutf8) {
       std::cout << "valid UTF-8" << std::endl;
   } else {
       std::cout << "invalid UTF-8" << std::endl;
       return EXIT_FAILURE;
   }
   char16_t utf16_output[4];
   // convert to UTF-16LE
   size_t utf16words = simdutf::convert_utf8_to_utf16(ascii, 4, utf16_output);
   std::cout << "wrote " << utf16words << " UTF-16 words." << std::endl;
   // It wrote utf16words * sizeof(char16_t) bytes.
   //
   // convert it back:
   char buffer[4];
   size_t utf8words = simdutf::convert_utf16_to_utf8(utf16_output, utf16words, buffer);
   std::cout << "wrote " << utf8words << " UTF-8 words." << std::endl;
   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
