simdutf: Unicode validation and transcoding at billions of characters per second
===============================================

Most modern software relies on the [Unicode standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).
In memory, Unicode strings are represented using either
UTF-8 or UTF-16. The UTF-8 format is the de facto standard on the web (JSON, HTML, etc.) and it has been adopted as the default in many popular
programming languages (Go, Rust, Swift, etc.). The UTF-16 format is standard in Java, C# and in many Windows technologies.

Not all sequences of bytes are valid Unicode strings. It is unsafe to use Unicode strings in UTF-8 and UTF-16LE without first validating them. Furthermore, we often need to convert strings from one encoding to another, by a process called [transcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding). For security purposes, such transcoding should be validating: it should refuse to transcode incorrect strings.

This library provide fast Unicode functions such as

- ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16LE/BE and UTF-32 validation, with and without error identification,
- Latin1 to UTF-8 transcoding,
- Latin1 to UTF-16LE/BE transcoding
- Latin1 to UTF-32 transcoding
- UTF-8 to Latin1 transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- UTF-8 to UTF-16LE/BE transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- UTF-8 to UTF-32 transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- UTF-16LE/BE to Latin1 transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- UTF-16LE/BE to UTF-8 transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- UTF-32 to Latin1 transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- UTF-32 to UTF-8 transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- UTF-32 to UTF-16LE/BE transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- UTF-16LE/BE to UTF-32 transcoding, with or without validation, with and without error identification,
- From an UTF-8 string, compute the size of the Latin1 equivalent string,
- From an UTF-8 string, compute the size of the UTF-16 equivalent string,
- From an UTF-8 string, compute the size of the UTF-32 equivalent string (equivalent to UTF-8 character counting),
- From an UTF-16LE/BE string, compute the size of the Latin1 equivalent string,
- From an UTF-16LE/BE string, compute the size of the UTF-8 equivalent string,
- From an UTF-32 string, compute the size of the UTF-8 or UTF-16LE equivalent string,
- From an UTF-16LE/BE string, compute the size of the UTF-32 equivalent string (equivalent to UTF-16 character counting),
- UTF-8 and UTF-16LE/BE character counting.
- UTF-16 endianness change (UTF16-LE/BE to UTF-16-BE/LE)

The functions are accelerated using SIMD instructions (e.g., ARM NEON, SSE, AVX, AVX-512, etc.). When your strings contain hundreds of characters, we can often transcode them at speeds exceeding a billion characters per second. You should expect high speeds not only with English strings (ASCII) but also Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and so forth. We handle the full character range (including, for example, emojis).

The library compiles down to a small library of a few hundred kilobytes. Our functions are exception-free and non allocating. We have extensive tests and extensive benchmarks.


Real-World Usage
-----

The simdutf library is used by:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (19.4.0 or better, 20.0 or better, 18.15 or better), a standard JavaScript runtime environment,
- [Bun](https://bun.sh), a fast JavaScript runtime environment,
- [graaljs](https://github.com/oracle/graaljs), a JavaScript implementation by Oracle,
- [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com), a popular database system,
- [haskell/text](https://github.com/haskell/text), a library for fast operations over Unicode text,
- [klogg](https://github.com/variar/klogg), a Really fast log explorer,
- [Pixie](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie), observability tool for Kubernetes applications.



How fast is it?
-----------------

The adoption of the simdutf library by the popular Node.js JavaScript runtime lead to a significant
performance gain:

> Decoding and Encoding becomes considerably faster than in Node.js 18. With the addition of simdutf for UTF-8 parsing the observed benchmark, results improved by 364% (an extremely impressive leap) when decoding in comparison to Node.js 16. ([State of Node.js Performance 2023](https://blog.rafaelgss.dev/state-of-nodejs-performance-2023))


<img src="doc/node2023.png" width="70%" />


Over a wide range of realistic data sources, the simdutf library transcodes a billion characters per second or more. Our approach can be 3 to 10 times faster than the popular ICU library on difficult (non-ASCII) strings. We can be 20x faster than ICU when processing easy strings (ASCII). Our good results apply to both recent x64 and ARM processors.


To illustrate, we present a benchmark result with values are in billions of characters processed by second. Consider the following figures.



<img src="doc/utf8utf16.png" width="70%" />

<img src="doc/utf16utf8.png" width="70%" />

If your system supports AVX-512, the simdutf library can provide very high performance. We get the following speed results on an Ice Lake Intel processor (both AVX2 and AVX-512) are simdutf kernels:

Datasets: https://github.com/lemire/unicode_lipsum

Please refer to our benchmarking tool for a proper interpretation of the numbers. Our results are reproducible.




Requirements
-------

- C++11 compatible compiler. We support LLVM clang, GCC, Visual Studio. (Our optional benchmark tool requires C++17.)
- For high speed, you should have a recent 64-bit system (e.g., ARM or x64).
- If you rely on CMake, you should use a recent CMake (at least 3.15) ; otherwise you may use the [single header version](#single-header-version). The library is also available from Microsoft's vcpkg.
- AVX-512 support require a processor with AVX512-VBMI2 (Ice Lake or better) and a recent compiler (GCC 8 or better, Visual Studio 2022 or better, LLVM clang 6 or better). You need a correspondingly recent assembler such as gas (2.30+) or nasm (2.14+): recent compilers usually come with recent assemblers. If you mix a recent compiler with an incompatible/old assembler (e.g., when using a recent compiler with an old Linux distribution), you may get errors at build time because the compiler produces instructions that the assembler does not recognize: you should update your assembler to match your compiler (e.g., upgrade binutils to version 2.30 or better under Linux) or use an older compiler matching the capabilities of your assembler.

Usage (Usage)
-------


We made a video to help you get started with the library.

[![the simdutf library](http://img.youtube.com/vi/H9NZtb7ykYs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9NZtb7ykYs)<br />


Quick Start
-----------

Linux or macOS users might follow the following instructions if they have a recent C++ compiler installed and the standard utilities (`wget`, `unzip`, etc.)


1. Pull the library in a directory
   ```
   wget https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf/releases/download/v4.0.8/singleheader.zip
   unzip singleheader.zip
   ```
2. Compile
   ```
   c++ -std=c++17 -o amalgamation_demo amalgamation_demo.cpp
   ```
3. `./amalgamation_demo`

   ```
   valid UTF-8
   wrote 4 UTF-16LE words.
   valid UTF-16LE
   wrote 4 UTF-8 words.
   1234
   perfect round trip
   ```

Usage (CMake)
-------

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
cd build
ctest .
```

Visual Studio users must specify whether they want to build the Release or Debug version.

To run benchmarks, execute the `benchmark` command. You can get help on its
usage by first building it and then calling it with the `--help` flag.
E.g., under Linux you may do the following:

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/benchmarks/benchmark --help
```

Instructions are similar for Visual Studio users.

To use the library as a CMake dependency in your project, please see `tests/installation_tests/from_fetch` for
an example.

Since ICU is so common and popular, we assume that you may have it already on your system. When
it is not found, it is simply omitted from the benchmarks. Thus, to benchmark against ICU, make
sure you have ICU installed on your machine and that cmake can find it. For macOS, you may
install it with brew using `brew install icu4c`. If you have ICU on your system but cmake cannot
find it, you may need to provide cmake with a path to ICU, such as `ICU_ROOT=/usr/local/opt/icu4c cmake -B build`.

Single-header version
----------------------

You can create a single-header version of the library where
all of the code is put into two files (`simdutf.h` and `simdutf.cpp`).
We publish a zip archive containing these files, e.g., see
https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf/releases/download/v4.0.8/singleheader.zip

You may generate it on your own using a Python script.

```
python3 ./singleheader/amalgamate.py
```

We require Python 3 or better.

Under Linux and macOS, you may test it as follows:

```
cd singleheader
c++ -o amalgamation_demo amalgamation_demo.cpp -std=c++17
./amalgamation_demo
```

Example
---------

Using the single-header version, you could compile the following program.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

#include "simdutf.cpp"
#include "simdutf.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  const char *source = "1234";
  // 4 == strlen(source)
  bool validutf8 = simdutf::validate_utf8(source, 4);
  if (validutf8) {
    std::cout << "valid UTF-8" << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cerr << "invalid UTF-8" << std::endl;
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
  // We need a buffer of size where to write the UTF-16LE code units.
  size_t expected_utf16words = simdutf::utf16_length_from_utf8(source, 4);
  std::unique_ptr<char16_t[]> utf16_output{new char16_t[expected_utf16words]};
  // convert to UTF-16LE
  size_t utf16words =
      simdutf::convert_utf8_to_utf16le(source, 4, utf16_output.get());
  std::cout << "wrote " << utf16words << " UTF-16LE code units." << std::endl;
  // It wrote utf16words * sizeof(char16_t) bytes.
  bool validutf16 = simdutf::validate_utf16le(utf16_output.get(), utf16words);
  if (validutf16) {
    std::cout << "valid UTF-16LE" << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cerr << "invalid UTF-16LE" << std::endl;
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
  // convert it back:
  // We need a buffer of size where to write the UTF-8 code units.
  size_t expected_utf8words =
      simdutf::utf8_length_from_utf16le(utf16_output.get(), utf16words);
  std::unique_ptr<char[]> utf8_output{new char[expected_utf8words]};
  // convert to UTF-8
  size_t utf8words = simdutf::convert_utf16le_to_utf8(
      utf16_output.get(), utf16words, utf8_output.get());
  std::cout << "wrote " << utf8words << " UTF-8 code units." << std::endl;
  std::string final_string(utf8_output.get(), utf8words);
  std::cout << final_string << std::endl;
  if (final_string != source) {
    std::cerr << "bad conversion" << std::endl;
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  } else {
    std::cerr << "perfect round trip" << std::endl;
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

API
-----

Our API is made of a few non-allocating functions. They typically take a pointer and a length as a parameter,
and they sometimes take a pointer to an output buffer. Users are responsible for memory allocation.

We use three types of data pointer types:
- `char*` for UTF-8 or indeterminate Unicode formats,
- `char16_t*` for UTF-16 (both UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE),
- `char32_t*` for UTF-32. UTF-32 is primarily used for internal use, not data interchange. Thus, unless otherwise stated, `char32_t` refers to the native type and is typically UTF-32LE since virtually all systems are little-endian today.
In generic terms, we refer to `char`, `char16_t`,  and `char32_t` as *code units*. A *character* may use several *code units*: between 1 and 4 code units in UTF-8, and between
1 and 2 code units in UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE.

Our functions and declarations are all in the `simdutf` namespace. Thus you should prefix our functions
and types with `simdutf::` as required.


We have basic functions to detect the type of an input. They return an integer defined by
the following `enum`.

```cpp
enum encoding_type {
        UTF8 = 1,       // BOM 0xef 0xbb 0xbf
        UTF16_LE = 2,   // BOM 0xff 0xfe
        UTF16_BE = 4,   // BOM 0xfe 0xff
        UTF32_LE = 8,   // BOM 0xff 0xfe 0x00 0x00
        UTF32_BE = 16,   // BOM 0x00 0x00 0xfe 0xff

        unspecified = 0
};
```

```cpp

/**
 * Autodetect the encoding of the input, a single encoding is recommended.
 * E.g., the function might return simdutf::encoding_type::UTF8,
 * simdutf::encoding_type::UTF16_LE, simdutf::encoding_type::UTF16_BE, or
 * simdutf::encoding_type::UTF32_LE.
 *
 * @param input the string to analyze.
 * @param length the length of the string in bytes.
 * @return the detected encoding type
 */
simdutf_warn_unused simdutf::encoding_type autodetect_encoding(const char * input, size_t length) noexcept;

/**
 * Autodetect the possible encodings of the input in one pass.
 * E.g., if the input might be UTF-16LE or UTF-8, this function returns
 * the value (simdutf::encoding_type::UTF8 | simdutf::encoding_type::UTF16_LE).
 *
 * Overridden by each implementation.
 *
 * @param input the string to analyze.
 * @param length the length of the string in bytes.
 * @return the detected encoding type
 */
simdutf_warn_unused int detect_encodings(const char * input, size_t length) noexcept;
```



For validation and transcoding, we also provide functions that will stop on error and return a result struct which is a pair of two fields:
```cpp
struct result {
  error_code error; // see `struct error_code`.
  size_t count; // In case of error, indicates the position of the error in the input in code units.
  // In case of success, indicates the number of code units validated/written.
};
```
On error, the `error` field indicates the type of error encountered and the `count` field indicates the position of the error in the input in code units or the number of characters validated/written.
We report six types of errors related to Latin1, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings:
```cpp
enum error_code {
  SUCCESS = 0,
  HEADER_BITS,  // Any byte must have fewer than 5 header bits.
  TOO_SHORT,    // The leading byte must be followed by N-1 continuation bytes, where N is the UTF-8 character length
                // This is also the error when the input is truncated.
  TOO_LONG,     // We either have too many consecutive continuation bytes or the string starts with a continuation byte.
  OVERLONG,     // The decoded character must be above U+7F for two-byte characters, U+7FF for three-byte characters,
                // and U+FFFF for four-byte characters.
  TOO_LARGE,    // The decoded character must be less than or equal to U+10FFFF,less than or equal than U+7F for ASCII OR less than equal than U+FF for Latin1
  SURROGATE,    // The decoded character must not be in U+D800...DFFF (UTF-8 or UTF-32) OR
                // a high surrogate must be followed by a low surrogate and a low surrogate must be preceded by a high surrogate (UTF-16) OR
                // there must be no surrogate at all (Latin1)
  OTHER         // Not related to validation/transcoding.
};

```
On success, the `error` field is set to `SUCCESS` and the `position` field indicates either the number of code units validated for validation functions or the number of written
code units in the output format for transcoding functions. In ASCII, Latin1 and UTF-8, code units occupy 8 bits (they are bytes); in UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE, code units occupy 16 bits; in UTF-32, code units occupy 32 bits.

Generally speaking, functions that report errors always stop soon after an error is
encountered and might therefore be faster on inputs where an error occurs early in the input.
The functions that return a boolean indicating whether or not an error has been encountered
are meant to be used in an *optimistic setting*---when we expect that inputs will almost always
be correct.

You may use functions that report an error to indicate where the problem happens during, as follows:

```cpp
  std::string bad_ascii = "\x20\x20\x20\x20\x20\xff\x20\x20\x20";
  simdutf::result res = implementation.validate_ascii_with_errors(bad_ascii.data(), bad_ascii.size());
  if(res.error != simdutf::error_code::SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "error at index " << res.count << std::endl;
  }
```

Or as follows:

```cpp
  std::string bad_utf8 = "\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa9\x20\xff\xc3\xa9";
  simdutf::result res = implementation.validate_utf8_with_errors(bad_utf8.data(), bad_utf8.size());
  if(res.error != simdutf::error_code::SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "error at index " << res.count << std::endl;
  }
  res = implementation.validate_utf8_with_errors(bad_utf8.data(), res.count);
  // will be successful in this case
  if(res.error == simdutf::error_code::SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "we have " << res.count << "valid bytes" << std::endl;
  }
```


We have fast validation functions.

Given a valid UTF-8 or UTF-16 input, you may count the number Unicode characters using
fast functions. For UTF-32, there is no need for a function given that each character
requires a flat 4 bytes. Likewise for Latin1: one byte will always equal one character.

```cpp
/**
 * Count the number of code points (characters) in the string assuming that
 * it is valid.
 *
 * This function assumes that the input string is valid UTF-16 (native endianness).
 *
 * This function is not BOM-aware.

Prior to transcoding an input, you need to allocate enough memory to receive the result.
We have fast function that scan the input and compute the size of the output. These functions
are fast and non-validating.

We have a wide range of conversion between Latin1, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. They assume
that you are allocated sufficient memory for the input. The simplest conversin
function output a single integer representing the size of the input, with a value of zero
indicating an error (e.g., `convert_utf8_to_utf16le`). They are well suited in the
scenario where you expect the input to be valid most of the time.

string, meaning that the last character might be incomplete. In such cases, we recommend
trimming the end of your input so you do not encounter an error.

```cpp

You may use these `trim_` functions to decode inputs piece by piece, as in the following
examples. First a case where you want to decode a UTF-8 strings in two steps:

```cpp
  const char unicode[] = "\xc3\xa9\x63ole d'\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9";
  // suppose you want to decode only the start of this string.
  size_t length = 10;
  // Picking 10 bytes is problematic because we might end up in the middle of a
  // code point. But we can rewind to the previous code point.
  length = simdutf::trim_partial_utf8(unicode, length);
  // Now we can transcode safely
  size_t budget_utf16 = simdutf::utf16_length_from_utf8(unicode, length);
  std::unique_ptr<char16_t[]> utf16{new char16_t[budget_utf16]};
  size_t utf16words =
      simdutf::convert_utf8_to_utf16le(unicode, length, utf16.get());
  // We can then transcode the next batch
  const char * next = unicode + length;
  size_t next_length = sizeof(unicode) - length;
  size_t next_budget_utf16 = simdutf::utf16_length_from_utf8(next, next_length);
  std::unique_ptr<char16_t[]> next_utf16{new char16_t[next_budget_utf16]};
  size_t next_utf16words =
      simdutf::convert_utf8_to_utf16le(next, next_length, next_utf16.get());
```

You can use the same approach with UTF-16:

```cpp  // We have three sequences of surrogate pairs (UTF-16).
  const char16_t unicode[] = u"\x3cd8\x10df\x3cd8\x10df\x3cd8\x10df";
  // suppose you want to decode only the start of this string.
  size_t length = 3;
  // Picking 3 units is problematic because we might end up in the middle of a
  // surrogate pair. But we can rewind to the previous code point.
  length = simdutf::trim_partial_utf16(unicode, length);
  // Now we can transcode safely
  size_t budget_utf8 = simdutf::utf8_length_from_utf16(unicode, length);
  std::unique_ptr<char[]> utf8{new char[budget_utf8]};
  size_t utf8words =
      simdutf::convert_utf16_to_utf8(unicode, length, utf8.get());
  // We can then transcode the next batch
  const char16_t * next = unicode + length;
  size_t next_length = 6 - length;
  size_t next_budget_utf8 = simdutf::utf8_length_from_utf16(next, next_length);
  std::unique_ptr<char[]> next_utf8{new char[next_budget_utf8]};
  size_t next_utf8words =
      simdutf::convert_utf16_to_utf8(next, next_length, next_utf8.get());
```


We have more advanced conversion functions which output a `simdutf::result` structure with
an indication of the error type and a `count` entry (e.g., `convert_utf8_to_utf16le_with_errors`).
They are well suited when you expect that there might be errors in the input that require
further investigation. The `count` field contains the location of the error in the input in code units,
if there is an error, or otherwise the number of code units written. You may use these functions as follows:

```cpp
  // this UTF-8 string has a bad byte at index 5
  std::string bad_utf8 = "\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa9\x20\xff\xc3\xa9";
  size_t budget_utf16 = simdutf::utf16_length_from_utf8(bad_utf8.data(), bad_utf8.size());
  std::unique_ptr<char16_t[]> utf16{new char16_t[budget_utf16]};
  simdutf::result res = simdutf::convert_utf8_to_utf16_with_errors(bad_utf8.data(), bad_utf8.size(), utf16.get());
  if(res.error != simdutf::error_code::SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "error at index " << res.count << std::endl;
  }
  // the following will be successful
  res = simdutf::convert_utf8_to_utf16_with_errors(bad_utf8.data(), res.count, utf16.get());
  if(res.error == simdutf::error_code::SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "we have transcoded " << res.count << " characters" << std::endl;
  }
```

We have several transcoding functions returning `simdutf::error` results:

```cpp

 *

```cpp
/**

 * @param output        the pointer to buffer that can hold the conversion result
 */
void change_endianness_utf16(const char16_t * input, size_t length, char16_t * output) noexcept;

```


The sutf command-line tool
------
We also provide a command-line tool which can be build as follows:
```
cmake -B build && cmake --build build --target sutf
```
This command builds the executable in `./build/tool/` under most platforms. The sutf tool enables the user to easily transcode files from one encoding to another directly from the command line.
The usage is similar to [iconv](https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) (see `sutf --help` for more details). The sutf command-line tool relies on the simdutf library functions for fast transcoding of supported
formats (UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE and UTF-32). If iconv is found on the system and simdutf does not support a conversion, the sutf tool falls back on iconv: a message lets the user know if iconv is available
during compilation. The following is an example of transcoding two input files to an output file, from UTF-8 to UTF-16LE:
```
sutf -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16LE -o output_file.txt first_input_file.txt second_input_file.txt
```

Manual implementation selection
-------------------------------

When compiling the llibrary for x64 processors, we build several implementations of each functions. At runtime, the best
implementation is picked automatically. Advanced users may want to pick a particular implementation, thus bypassing our
runtime detection. It is possible and even relatively convenient to do so. The following C++ program checks all the available
implementation, and selects one as the default:

```cpp
#include "simdutf.h"
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  // This is just a demonstration, not actual testing required.
  std::string source = "La vie est belle.";
  std::string chosen_implementation;
  for (auto &implementation : simdutf::get_available_implementations()) {
    if (!implementation->supported_by_runtime_system()) {
      continue;
    }
    bool validutf8 = implementation->validate_utf8(source.c_str(), source.size());
    if (!validutf8) {
      return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    std::cout << implementation->name() << ": " << implementation->description()
              << std::endl;
    chosen_implementation = implementation->name();
  }
  auto my_implementation =
      simdutf::get_available_implementations()[chosen_implementation];
  if (!my_implementation) {
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
  if (!my_implementation->supported_by_runtime_system()) {
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
  simdutf::get_active_implementation() = my_implementation;
  bool validutf8 = simdutf::validate_utf8(source.c_str(), source.size());
  if (!validutf8) {
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
  if (simdutf::get_active_implementation()->name() != chosen_implementation) {
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
  std::cout << "I have manually selected: " << simdutf::get_active_implementation()->name() << std::endl;
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
