simdutf: insanely fast Unicode validation and transcoding
===============================================

This library provide fast Unicode functions such as

- UTF-8 and UTF-16 validation
- UTF-8 to UTF-16 transcoding, with or without validation.
- UTF-16 to UTF-8 transcoding, with or without validation.
- UTF-8 and UTF-16 character counting

The functions are accelerated using SIMD instructions
(e.g., ARM NEON, SSE, AVX, etc.).

Requirements
-------

- C++11 compatible compiler. We support LLVM clang, GCC, Visual Studio. (Our optional benchmark tool requires C++17.)
- Recent CMake (at least 3.15)

Usage
-------

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
cd build
ctest .
```

To run benchmarks, execute the `benchmark` command. You can get help on its
usage by first building it and then calling it with the `--help` flag.
E.g., under Linux you may do the following:

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/benchmarks/benchmark --help
```

Single-header version
----------------------

You can create a single-header version of the library where
all of the code is put into two files (`simdutf.h` and `simdutf.cpp`).

```
python3 ./singleheader/amalgamate.py
```

Under Linux and macOS, you may test it as follows:

```
cd singleheader
c++ -o amalgamation_demo amalgamation_demo.cpp -std=c++17
./amalgamation_demo
```

Example
---------

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include "simdutf.h"
#include "simdutf.cpp"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   const char * ascii = "1234";
   bool validutf8 = simdutf::validate_utf8(ascii, 4);
   if(validutf8) {
       std::cout << "valid UTF-8" << std::endl;
   } else {
       std::cout << "invalid UTF-8" << std::endl;
       return EXIT_FAILURE;
   }
   char16_t utf16_output[4];
   // convert to UTF-16LE
   size_t utf16words = simdutf::convert_utf8_to_utf16(ascii, 4, utf16_output);
   std::cout << "wrote " << utf16words << " UTF-16 words." << std::endl;
   // It wrote utf16words * sizeof(char16_t) bytes.
   //
   // convert it back:
   char buffer[4];
   size_t utf8words = simdutf::convert_utf16_to_utf8(utf16_output, utf16words, buffer);
   std::cout << "wrote " << utf8words << " UTF-8 words." << std::endl;
   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
