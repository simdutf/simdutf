# Cuneicode

> If you follow the River, you will find the C.

This library is the hyper-focused span-based C library for Unicode Transformation Format encoding and decoding that is implementing the ideas found in [n2431/n2440](https://thephd.github.io/_vendor/future_cxx/papers/source/n2440.html) as well as a few more. It aims to be more extensible and friendly than `iconv`'s library, enabling programmatic, run-time extension for arbitrary encodings rather than baking them in at compile-time.

It also enables arbitrary conversions between two disparate encodings by allowing a user to program to one of several recognized internal Unicode encodings.
