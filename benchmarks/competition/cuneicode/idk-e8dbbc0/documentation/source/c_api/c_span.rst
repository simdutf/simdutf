``c_span``
==========

``c_span`` is a type that is generated by defining the macro ``ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_TYPE`` to a specific type name and including the header ``#include <ztd/idk/c_span.g.h>``. Occasionally, some types include spaces or similar, and therefore need some additional tweaking in order to handle it all properly. This comes up to forming 3 different macros which can help control configuration:

- ``ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_TYPE``, the type;
- ``ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_TYPE_IS_CONST``, an optional definition that, if defined,  must be either 1 or 0. If 1, it indicates that the stored pointer should be to a `const T` type;
- ``ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_TYPE_NAME``, an optional name of the type if it should not be derived directly from the type itself (defaults to ``ZTD_ID_C_SPAN_TYPE``);
- ``ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_SIZE_TYPE``, an optional type name used to control the type for the storage of the ``size`` (defaults to ``size_t``).
- ``ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_SIZE_TYPE_NAME``, an optional suffix for the ``c_span``\ 's name to override the default which is generated from the type (defaults to ``ZTD_ID_C_SPAN_SIZE_TYPE``); and,
- ``ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_NAME``, an optional override for the entire name of the structure and its functions (ignores all previous name-based derivations).
- ``ZTD_IDK_C_SPAN_SIZE_FIRST``, an optional definition that, if defined, must be either 1 or 0. If 1, it indicates that the size member should go first.

The final name is composed of either just the type name suffixed on ``c_span``; the type name and the size type name (if defined) suffixed onto ``c_span``; or, the the full name provided in the override.

.. important::

	Any macros that are consumed by this header are undefined by the end of the header, including the ones listed above.

The ``<ztd/idk/c_span.h>`` header includes some common definitions of a ``c_span`` to be used, most notably ``c_span_uchar``. The documentation below is for ``c_span_uchar``, but works for all entities.
